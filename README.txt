CS 4641: Randomized Optimization
Author: Bradley Reardon

Code

    Code can be found at https://github.com/bradreardon/cs4641-randomized-optimization.

Requirements
    
    Running ABAGAIL (randomized_optimization package)
    - Jython 2.7+
    - JDK
    - Apache Ant

    Plotting results  (plot_scripts package)
    - Python 3.7+
    - matplotlib
    - The run.sh script assumes that pyenv is being used for version management, and that a `cs4641` virtual envrionment exists with these requirements.

Running

    All commands used to run this project, for both running algorithms and plotting, can be found commented in run.sh. Each command is annotated with an echo command describing what function it runs.

Attribution
